# GitHub Project Management

## ðŸ“Œ Project Scope
This project demonstrates how to manage tasks, scope, and workflows using GitHub only (without Jira integration).  
It covers defining scope, acceptance criteria, Definition of Done (DoD), and a simple Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- Clear project scope documented.  
- WBS defined with stories, tasks, and subtasks.  
- Issues created in GitHub matching the WBS.  
- A GitHub Project board configured to manage workflow.  

---

## ðŸ“‹ Definition of Done (DoD)
- All issues completed and moved to **Done** column.  
- README.md updated with latest documentation.  
- Project board reflects final state of tasks.
